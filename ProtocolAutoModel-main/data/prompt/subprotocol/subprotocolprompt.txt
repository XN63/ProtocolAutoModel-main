You are a protocol analysis expert.  
Given the following RFC9000 corpus context packet, extract all subprotocols (modules) defined in QUIC.
For each subprotocol/module, provide:
- name
- description/purpose (summarize from evidence)
- order (from toc)
- dependencies (if mentioned)
- section and anchor (for traceability)

ContextPacket:
{protocol_document}

Output the result as a JSON array, each item:
{{
  "subprotocol": "Module name",
  "description": "Purpose and main function",
  "order": 2,
  "dependencies": ["other module names"],
  "section": "2",
  "anchor": "#name-streams"
}}

Only use information from the provided context. Do not invent content.  
If dependencies are not explicit, leave as an empty array.
